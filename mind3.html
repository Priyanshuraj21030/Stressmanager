                            Key Points to keep in mind:
                            Being present means focusing on one thing and feeling whatever emotion we feel when we feel it, even challenging ones.
                            The more we practice being present, the more comfortable we'll feel when we experience tough emotions.
                            Mindfulness and meditation help us notice thoughts and feelings when they come up — the first step in learning how to be more present.

                        <p class="lead">The biggest gift we can each give ourselves is the gift of being present — engaged with life, connected with each other, listening with kindness, staying open-minded, free from judgment. The ability to be present, no matter what's going on around us, is the cornerstone of meditation and mindfulness.We hear a lot of people say it: “I want to be more present”. So how does that look in reality?
                            On the most basic level, being present means being focused on one thing — a conversation, a project, a task in hand — without distraction, without wanting to be somewhere else, without being in your head and lost in thought.
                            At a deeper level — and this is what meditation teaches us over time — it means being able to sit with challenging emotions that we feel, when we feel them. It may happen when we sit to take a deep breath or when we're triggered by circumstances or situations in everyday life. No matter what we feel, we sit and experience that feeling.
                            To be more present with happiness, feel joy. To be more present with anger, feel angry. To be more present with sadness, feel sad. To be more present with anxiety, feel anxious. And then, once we've felt it, we're better able to let that emotion go so it doesn't overwhelm us and mess so much with our mood that day.
                            Of course, learning to anchor yourself to the present moment is easier said than done, especially when most people have a tendency to dwell on yesterday or worry about tomorrow. Meditation can help bridge the gap between emotions from the past and eagerness of the future ... and that’s why it teaches us how to be more present in life.

                            When you do a body scan meditation — mentally scan how your body is feeling from head to toe — you're bringing awareness to every ache, pain, or sensation you might be feeling. When you breathe into these senses, you are learning to sit in the present moment and pay attention to every physical and emotional feeling that comes to light. You’re not changing anything, you are simply noticing everything — which is the first step in becoming present.

                        <p class="lead">Believe it or not, eating can become an incredible tool to help cultivate mindfulness in the present moment. Many of us are on the go so much that we're often eating on autopilot between meetings, at red lights, or even in conversation. When we practice mindful eating, we engage all the senses and take time to savor a meal. You can use the practice of engaging the senses even when not eating, which gives you the opportunity to cultivate presence physically and mentally — similar to the body scan. Eating is something that we experience every single day, so it’s a simple time to start encouraging this practice.

Allow yourself a few moments each day to willingly close your screen and turn off your volume — to think about the here and now — your priorities, how you’re feeling, your breath. This allows you to take back control on the trajectory of your day, versus the distractions taking control and piling up lower priority items in front of you

Finding a routine that is built on the precedent that you are a priority can help you feel anchored when it comes to decision-making throughout the day. When we're learning how to be more present, finding time for daily meditation can be instrumental. If you have more leeway in the mornings, consider opting for daily morning meditations, if you have a few moments during your commute, consider listening to soothing music in your car. Once you find a meditation routine that sticks, you have the opportunity to strengthen your mental health — which supports the quest of learning how to be more present in life.
                            The benefit of learning how to live in the moment goes far beyond productivity and goals, but it allows you to trust yourself, spend quality time with those you love, and find great joy in all of your experiences. If we can do this, then we will experience an increasing sense of confidence, in being at ease with both comfort and discomfort, difficulty and joy.
